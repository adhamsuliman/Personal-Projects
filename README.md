# Personal-Projects

This repository showcases the personal projects I have pursued during my free time. 

Within the Toxic Comments file, a convolutional nueral network and a recurrent neural network (LSTM) are used to identify toxic comments within Yelp's user threads. The algorithm created was able to produce an F1 score which put me in the top 20% of all participants.
