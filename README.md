# Personal-Projects

This repository showcases the personal projects I have pursued during my free time. 

Within the NLP folder resides the Toxic Comments python file.  A convolutional nueral network and a recurrent neural network (LSTM) are used to identify toxic comments within Yelp's user threads. The algorithm created was able to produce an F1 score which put me in the top 20% of all participants. 

Within the Pyspark folder resides the PySpark with Multinmial Logistic Regression python file.  Pyspark was used to process over 5 GB worth of data in order to determine a reviews star rating utilizng the text within the review.

Within the Reinforcement Learning folder resides Deep Reinforcement Learning With Pacman file. Utilizing a Deep Q-network, I was able to train an online network and target network to play Pacman acheiving an average "lifespan" score of 155 frames.

Within the Zillow Scraper folder resides the code utilized in my Capstone to scrape zillow housing data within the city of Chicago.
